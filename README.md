# Warehouse API

This Java Spring Boot REST API repository of a grocery warehouse API serves as the core component responsible for handling and managing data related to the grocery warehouse operations. It provides a structured and efficient way to interact with the API's underlying database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on grocery-related entities.

# Requirements

This API can be run using docker

```console
$ docker-compose up --build
```

# Postman Collections

I've included a directory [PostmanCollections](/PostmanCollections/) containing various API requests split into collections made to be imported into Postman.

- [Company](/PostmanCollections/Company.postman_collection.json)
- [Deliveries](/PostmanCollections/Deliveries.postman_collection.json)
- [Person](/PostmanCollections/Person.postman_collection.json)
- [Product](/PostmanCollections/Product.postman_collection.json)
